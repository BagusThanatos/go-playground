###Let's play!

##My Development Environment
4coder(https://4coder.itch.io/4coder) is my text editor of choice as it's simple and fast. No, I don't use GVim on my own, I'd only use it if I have to.
It's still in the alpha release though, so beware. Ah I sometimes also use Notepad++.

##Coding Conventions:
I'm trying to follow Go conventions as much as possible, but please bear with me if I mixed things up.

##Structure
This repository will contain my attempts on playing with the Go programming Language.
Each folder will represent different 'plays' and need to be build separately. There will be separate build executable for all of them.

##Before Building and Running
Please make sure you have Go installed in your machine.
If you don't, you can check https://golang.org/doc/install.

##Building and Running
I don't use make or any other things.
Please watch this if you want to know why:
https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day001/
With that, just run build.sh or build.bat from each FOLDER. Do not build from the project root folder.
It will also run tests on all test cases found in the project.
